hybridPon
=========

* Shortdesc:	"hybridPon" is a network simulation model based on OMNeT++
				for hybrid TDM/WDM-PONs.
* Author:		Kyeong Soo (Joseph) Kim (kimks@ieee.org)
* License:		GPL
* Requires:		OMNeT++ 4.0 or later

The "hybridPon" is a simulator for a broad range of hybrid TDM/WDM-PONs
based on the OMNeT++ to evaluate performances of various MAC protocols
and scheduling algorithms.

* Features:
  - Modular design allowing dynamic loading of different MAC and
    schedulers at run time

* Note:
  This project originally started as a joint work between Stanford
  Networking Research Center (SNRC), Photonics & Networking Research
  Lab (PNRL), Stanford, and Advanced System Technology (AST),
  STMicrolectronics.
  Now it is being developed and maintained by Hybrid Networking
  Research Lab (HNRL), Swansea University, Wales, UK.
